## 3 Core Types and Structures

### Video List:
3. Setting up TypeScript (Installing & Using TS)

We will be discussing...

1. Distinguish between TypeScript's basic types, like number, string, and boolean.

2. Create and manipulate arrays and objects while enforcing type safety.

- Primatives: number, string, boolean
- More complex types: arrays, objects
- Function types, parameters

- Object Type Definition
- Avoiding the "any" keyword, as this defeats the purpose of TS in JS
- Tuples

Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Example:
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.

Tuples are written with round brackets.
