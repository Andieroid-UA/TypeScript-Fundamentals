## 5: Functions and Interfaces

### Video List:
5. Union Types, Type Aliases, Function Types, Generics, Class structures, and Interfaces.

We will be discussing...

1. Define and utilize typed functions, ensuring the safety of parameters and return values.

2. Design interfaces that promote consistency and robustness in object shapes.


- You can access all of the items in the class or functions, UNLESS you add the private keyword. Get a lot more if you use "slice" if you want certain bits of information from your data

- Interfaces
Basically Object-type definitions. An alternative to "Type" keyword, but unlike type it has a certain structure need a class to have a certain method/class

- Compiling

Typescript conflict complier file

npx tsc --init
*Creates a tsconfig.json file*

strict mode is set to true, by default. TS does strict type checking. But also warns if there is not an explicit type when in your script.

In Angular, we get TS out of the box.
